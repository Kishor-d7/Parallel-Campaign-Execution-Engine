# Parallel Campaign Execution Engine

Inspired by a startup hiring challenge (2025).

## Problem Summary
- Simulates campaign execution with priority handling (P0, P1)
- Uses multithreading logic (or simulation of it)
- Prioritizes premium campaigns before standard
- Optimizes for minimal execution time

## Skills Demonstrated
- Algorithm design
- Scheduling logic
- Simulated multi-threading
- Priority queues and batch processing

## Output
Total time taken to execute all campaigns efficiently.
